# Transfering data with Globus

The simplest way to transfer data is to use the graphical environment of [globus.org](https://www.globus.org).
The data of the Quijote simulations can be accessed by typing Quijote_simulations in Collection.

For instance, if you want to transfer all halo catalogues to your local machine, select the Halos folder, log in into the machine where you want to transfer the data, and click on the start buttom.
