# Quijote simulations
The Quijote simulations are a set of 25000 N-body simulations designed for two main tasks:
- Quantify the information content on cosmological observables
- Provide enough statistics to train machine learning algorithms

### Features
- 15000 simulations for a fiducial Planck cosmology
- 500 simulations/cosmology for 15 different cosmologies
- 2000 simulations in a latin hypercube expanding 5 cosmological parameters
- 512^3 CDM particles (+512^3 neutrino particles) per simulation
- Boxes of 1 Gpc/h
- Outputs at redshifts 0, 0.5, 1, 2 and 3
- 500 Tb of data
- 15 Million cpu hours
- Snapshots and data products (halo and voids catalogues, power spectra, bispectra, pdfs...) publicly available
